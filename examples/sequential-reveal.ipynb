    "The following markdown cell will contain some content which we might want to reveal sequentially, like the animation features of Powerpoint or Google Slides.\n",
    "\n",
    "The C# cell below that will render the sections from the markdown cell one by one. It relies on VSCode auto saving the notebook file, as reading the notebook file is the only way it detect which markdown lines have been output. Its a bit of a hack but it works and easier than extensing the polyglot notebook VSCode extension! \n",
    "\n",
    "In a presentation you would minimise the markdown cell and repeatedly run the the C# cell to sequentially show the content sections.\n",

    "* Build the csharp project, otherwise the project reference `#r` will not be able to find the dll\n",

    "### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "when the C# cell is executed:\n",
    "- the method loads and deserialises the notebook file\n",
    "- it finds the current cell by tag (note \"cell1\" in the example, set on the cell and passed into the method as an arg)\n",
    "- it then finds the previous cell in order to get the markdown from its Source\n",
    "- it will split the markdown into sections\n",
    "- it then looks at the Outputs of the current cell and determines how many sections have been shown so far\n",
    "- finally it builds the new output as a string on which `.DisplayAs(\"text/markdown\");` is called\n",
    "- VSCode then displays the new output and after around a second, saves the notebook file\n",
    "\n",
    "hint: If using this method more than once in a notebook, Cell Tags need to be unique!"
