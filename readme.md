# VSCode Polyglot Notebook Presentation Tools

Polyglot notebooks are an excellent choice for presenting concepts and then proving or demoing in code of various languages or visually with images|diagrams|videos.
As someone who does techgnical talks including live coding and demos along with slides and animated diagrams etc, I am convinced that polyglot notebooks are also an excellent choice for live presentations at conferences, meetings, meetups etc

There are however a few things either missing or non-obvious, this repo is my stash of tools, hints, examples and experiments. Enjoy!ðŸ˜„

Annoyingly the following links open the json files rather than polyglot notebooks in VSCode, so better to find these files in the examples directly and open them from there instead.

- [Animating SVG diagrams with Vivus.js](examples/animated-svg.ipynb)
- [Sequentially Reveal markdown sections](examples/sequential-reveal.ipynb)
- [Guard some space with an image which fades out nicely](examples/space-with-images.ipynb)
- [Make markdown fontsizes larger for presenting on a large screen, without zooming in too much](examples/make-md-fontsizes-larger.ipynb)
